# Starbase
this will be for all of my Starbase YOLOL code

each file is a different YOLOL chip in the game

YOLOL has a max of 70 characters per line and a max of 20 lines, after line 20 it repeates, so I may start leaving comments on line 21+

the YOLOL.xml is a user defined language for Notepad++
